Comment: using either Max or Sum since the test case are all one-entry. 

Alternative: 
```sql
select 
    id,
    max( case when month = 'Jan' then revenue else null end ) as "Jan_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Feb' then revenue else null end ) as "Feb_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Mar' then revenue else null end ) as "Mar_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Apr' then revenue else null end ) as "Apr_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'May' then revenue else null end ) as "May_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Jun' then revenue else null end ) as "Jun_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Jul' then revenue else null end ) as "Jul_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Aug' then revenue else null end ) as "Aug_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Sep' then revenue else null end ) as "Sep_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Oct' then revenue else null end ) as "Oct_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Nov' then revenue else null end ) as "Nov_Revenue",
    max( case when month = 'Dec' then revenue else null end ) as "Dec_Revenue"
