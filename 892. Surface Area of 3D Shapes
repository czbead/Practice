**I). Naive**
| O(T): O(mn) | O(S): O(mn) | Rt: 80ms | 
```python
    def surfaceArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rst = sum([(i * 4) + 2 for row in grid for i in row if i])
        row = sum(min(i, j) for row in grid for i, j in zip(row, row[1:])) * 2
        col = sum(min(i, j) for col in zip(*grid) for i, j in zip(col, col[1:])) * 2
        return rst - row - col 
```
Comment: first calculate the overall surface area of towers in grids. Then remove the overlapped area. The overlapped area has two parts: overlapped in a row, overlapped in a column. Ant the overlapped area is the min of two adjacent towers. Once overlapped, should remove 2 * overlapped area. 
Alternative: lambda fashion.  | Rt: 84ms |
```python
    def surfaceArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    	#sum up the surface area of all tower consists of cubes
        rst = sum([(i * 4) + 2 for row in grid for i in row if i])
        #calculate the overlapped surface area in a row or in a column (once, should count twice), 
        getOverlapArea = lambda x: sum(min(i, j) for i, j in zip(x, x[1:]))
        #sum up the overlapped area in all rows
        row = sum(getOverlapArea(row) for row in grid) * 2
        #sum up the overlapped area in all columns
        col = sum(getOverlapArea(col) for col in zip(*grid)) * 2
        #overall surface area subtract the overlapped area give you the real surface area
        return rst - row - col 
``` 


**II). One Pass -- One by One**
| O(T): O(n) | O(S): O(1) | Rt: 92ms | 
```python
    def surfaceArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rst = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j]: rst += (4 * grid[i][j]) + 2
                if i: rst -= min(grid[i][j], grid[i-1][j]) * 2
                if j: rst -= min(grid[i][j], grid[i][j-1]) * 2
        return rst
```
