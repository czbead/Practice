        for i, j, k in bookings:

            #the j-th flight is a rst[j-1], will be covered, since the j+1-th flight (rst[j]), we will not add k to it anymore by nutralizing with -k
            if j < n: rst[j] -= k
        #add on, kind of prefix sum

Comment: this problem is quite tricky, I bet I hardly can remember this trick next time I meet it.
